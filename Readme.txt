File Overview:

*.docx:
All .docx documents are the associated files used to develop
ideas and actual scripts used for the story in the program.

gameStart.cpp:
The main .cpp file written in C++.  It contains the majority
of game functions for the project and dictates the program's
ability to increment further.

gameStart.h: 
Header file for the main program, pretty self-explanatory

quest.cpp:
Contains the main quest for the user to iterate through.


Command to compile:

g++ -o test01.out gameStart.cpp quest.cpp
./test01.out

Note that this program is designed only for the command line, 
and should be run inside of it in its current state.
